#### When I first started this portfolio, it was just front end (HTML5 and CSS). As I learn more about full-stack development, I added routing and the use of Express to host it myself on Heroku. I also added a touch of Javascript, which will keep growing as I stay a life-long learner of code. I love CSS and Javascript together most, but it's exciting to use node.js and express and creating API routes. 

#### The portfolio page shows a mix of technologies including:
#### * HTML5
#### * CSS
#### * Javascript and jQuery
#### * node.js
#### * Express
#### * Inquirer.js
#### * mySQL and Sequelize
#### * MongoDB
#### * React
#### * ...and more

#### I look to solve issues inherent in UI and how users feel about the web applications they use. I love the ability to create in code all the feelings and expressions I've been studying in design and psychology all my life. Thank you for visiting!

#### I am the sole contributor to this portfolio. (A couple of the featured applications on the portfolio page showcase collaborative projects.)
